  - Boundary map extracted via inline string operations (indexOf + slice) rather than importing extractSection from files.ts — avoids coupling to unexported function
  - Plan parsing moved before insertSlice to make goal available at insertion time instead of using a post-insert upsert

# T02: Extend migrateHierarchyToDb to populate v8 planning columns (vision, successCriteria, boundaryMapMarkdown on milestones; goal on slices; files/verify on tasks)

**Extend migrateHierarchyToDb to populate v8 planning columns (vision, successCriteria, boundaryMapMarkdown on milestones; goal on slices; files/verify on tasks)**

## What Happened

Extended `migrateHierarchyToDb()` in `md-importer.ts` to populate v8 planning columns from parsed markdown during recovery/migration.

**Milestone planning columns:** Refactored to parse the roadmap once (not twice) — saved the `parseRoadmap()` result early and reused it. Added inline extraction of the raw `## Boundary Map` section from roadmap markdown (finds heading, takes content until next `##` or EOF). The `insertMilestone()` call now passes `planning: { vision, successCriteria, boundaryMapMarkdown }`. Per D004, tool-only fields (keyRisks, requirementCoverage, proofStrategy, etc.) are left empty.

**Slice planning columns:** Restructured the loop to parse the plan file *before* `insertSlice()` (previously parsed after). The `insertSlice()` call now passes `planning: { goal: plan.goal }`. When no plan file exists, goal defaults to empty string.

**Task planning columns:** The `insertTask()` call now passes `planning: { files: taskEntry.files ?? [], verify: taskEntry.verify ?? '' }` from the `TaskPlanEntry` parsed by `parsePlan()`.

**Test extensions:** Enhanced the `gsd-recover.test.ts` fixtures — added `## Success Criteria` and `## Boundary Map` sections to the ROADMAP fixture, and `- Files:` / `- Verify:` lines to all task entries in both PLAN fixtures. Added a comprehensive test block (Test a2) with 27 assertions verifying: milestone vision matches fixture, success_criteria populated with correct entries, boundary_map_markdown contains expected content, D004 tool-only fields remain empty (key_risks, requirement_coverage, proof_level), slice goals populated for both S01 and S02, task files arrays populated correctly, task verify strings populated (discovered parser preserves backtick formatting), and SQL-level queryability diagnostics for all v8 columns.

## Verification

Ran gsd-recover.test.ts — all 65 assertions pass including 27 new v8 column population assertions. Ran 7 regression suites (migrate-hierarchy.test.ts: 57 pass, derive-state-crossval.test.ts: 189 pass, integration-proof.test.ts: 3 pass, derive-state-db.test.ts: 105 pass, doctor.test.ts: 55 pass, auto-recovery.test.ts: 33 pass, auto-dashboard.test.ts: 24 pass, planning-crossval.test.ts: 65 pass, markdown-renderer.test.ts: 106 pass, flag-file-db.test.ts: 14 pass) — zero regressions.

## Deviations

Discovered that parsePlan() preserves backtick formatting in verify fields (e.g. `` `npm test` `` not `npm test`). Adjusted test expectations to match. Refactored roadmap parsing to avoid double parseRoadmap() call — the function was called once for title and again for slices; now parsed once with result reused. Changed the loop guard from `if (!roadmapContent) continue` to `if (!roadmap) continue` to match the refactored variable.

## Known Issues

None.
